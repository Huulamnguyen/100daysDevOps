<img src="assets/images/devops-loop.svg" width="1100" height="800">

### Description:

The challenge involves committing to learning and implementing DevOps principles for 100 consecutive days and sharing my progress with the DevOps community on GitHub, Medium, and my personal blog on my portfolio

### Goals:

The goal of the challenge is to help me enhance their skills and knowledge in DevOps practices, gain hands-on experience with relevant tools, and build a strong network of peers in the DevOps community. 

Through daily commits and sharing progress with others, I can hold myself accountable and track my progress throughout the challenge.

The 100 Days of DevOps challenge is an excellent opportunity for developers and IT professionals to advance their careers and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends. 

By participating in the challenge, individuals can improve their understanding of DevOps principles, enhance their problem-solving skills, and build a portfolio of DevOps projects that they can showcase to potential employers.

#### 1. Introduction to Operating Systems <a name="introduction-to-operating-systems"></a>

**What is operating system?**
    
Operating System (OS) is a software managing: 
- computer hardware,
- software resources
- and provides common services for computer programs

OS as abstraction layer between applications and hardware. Which means that instead of applications (like browser) interacting with the computer hardware directly, they can use the OS as abstraction layer between the two

**Tasks of an Operating System**
1. Resource Allocation and Management
    - Process Management (CPU)
    - Memory Management (RAM): Allocating working memory (RAM = Rapid Access Memory) to applications
    - Storage Management (Hard Drive): Persisting data long-term, like files, browser configurations, games, pictures, videos etc

2. File Management
    - Files are stored in structured way A file system is organized into directories
    - On Unix system: tree file system
    - On Windows OS: multiple root folders

3. Device Management
    - Manages device communication via their respective drivers
    - Monitor, keyboards, mouse, printers, etc.

4. Other important tasks
    - Security:
        - Managing Users and Permissions
        - Each user has its own space and permissions
    - Networking:
        - Ports and IP addresses
        - Transmitting outgoing data from all application ports onto the network, and forwarding arriving network packets to processes

**Operating System Components**
1. Kernel
    - Heart of every OS
    - The core program that provides basic services for all other parts of the OS
    - Consists of device drivers, dispatcher, scheduler, file system etc.
    - Controls all hardware resources via device drivers
    - Kernel starts the process for app, Allocates resources to app, Cleans up the resources when app shuts down
2. Application Layer:

On the top is kernel is the application layer. For instance:

- For example different Linux distributions: Ubuntu, Mint, CentOS, Debian. Different application layers, but based on same Linux kernel
- Android is also based on **Linux kernel**
- MacOS and iOS is based on a different Kernel called **Darwin**

3. How to interact with Kernel
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Command-Line Interface (CLI)

**3 Main Operating Systems**
- Linux, Windows, Mac OS

**Client OS vs Server OS**
CLient OS:
    - For personal computers with GUI and Input/Output (I/O) devices

Server OS:
    - Linux and Windows have server distributions
    - But Linux most widely used
    - More light-weight and performant
    - No GUI or other user applications

**Why Linux is a must for Devops Engineer**
- Linux is mostly used OS for servers!
- Known Linux is a must for DeVops Engineer
